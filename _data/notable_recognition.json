I have a belief one of the key items I have learned about amazing leaders...it’s not necessarily what they did when they were there. The true testament of a leader is if the leaders principles live on for others to progress when the leader moves on. Great work my friend, 42 Thrives."

These task were very time consuming on engineers and administrators. This was not an easy task since there were 5 separate and very different platforms that he needed to code for based on their API capabilities. This new platform will free up several man hours per request and allow adminstrators and engineers to concentrate on more pressing work."
